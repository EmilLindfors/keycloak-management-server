## High Priority (for external usage)

### 🧪 Testing Strategy
- [x] **Basic Integration Tests** ✅ COMPLETE
  - [x] 8/8 integration tests passing ✅
  - [x] Fixed unsafe environment variable operations for Rust edition 2024 ✅
  - [x] TestContainers infrastructure ready for Docker environments ✅

- [x] **Mock-Based Testing Infrastructure** ✅ READY
  - [x] Comprehensive testing roadmap created (`tests/TODO_TESTS.md`) ✅
  - [x] Mock framework started for hexagonal architecture ✅
  - [x] Service layer testing strategy defined ✅
  - [ ] **Next Phase**: Fix API compatibility and implement comprehensive service tests
  - [ ] **Target**: 90%+ test coverage without external dependencies

  - [ ] Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

### 🔐 Advanced Security
- [ ] **Enhanced security features**
  - [ ] Input sanitization and validation
  - [ ] Audit logging for all operations
  - [ ] Rate limiting for API calls

## Low Priority

### 🌟 Advanced Features
- [ ] **Multi-realm operations**
  - [ ] Cross-realm user migration
  - [ ] Realm synchronization
  - [ ] Bulk realm operations

### 📈 Observability
- [ ] **Metrics and monitoring**
  - [ ] Prometheus metrics export
  - [ ] Performance dashboards
  - [ ] Distributed tracing

## Notes

This domain layer now provides:

1. **Clean Architecture** - Proper separation of concerns with hexagonal architecture
2. **Type Safety** - Strong typing prevents runtime errors  
3. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive domain error types with proper context
4. **Testability** - Easy to test with mockable repository traits
5. **Extensibility** - Easy to add new repository implementations
6. **Production Ready** - Full CRUD operations for all Keycloak entities

The domain layer is the solid foundation for any Keycloak integration and can be used independently or with the management API.
