# Keycloak Project Suite - TODO

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Keycloak management suite with three main components:

1. **keycloak-domain** - Domain-driven design implementation for Keycloak
2. **keycloak-management-api** - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Keycloak management
3. **keycloak** - Core Keycloak API client library
4. **rust-sdk** - Rust SDK for MCP protocol

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.85+ (required for Rust edition 2024)
- Docker (for testing with real Keycloak)
- No OpenSSL required (uses rustls-tls consistently)

### Development Workflow
1. **Start with keycloak-domain** - Core domain logic and entities
2. **Use keycloak-management-api** - MCP server for external integration  
3. **Reference keycloak** - Low-level API client
4. **Leverage rust-sdk** - MCP protocol implementation

### Running Tests
```bash
# Domain tests (all passing âœ…)
cd keycloak-domain && cargo test

# Integration tests
cd keycloak-domain && cargo test --test integration_test

# Management API tests  
cd keycloak-management-api && cargo test
```
